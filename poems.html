        <h2>First Mate</h2>
        <p>She is like a summer's day,
        for when she leaves,
        my heart and I are left cold and dark.
        My heart transforms into the dreariest winter day.
        And when she returns,
        the birds begin to sing,
        and the sun begins to rise,
        and my heart thaws into a River of happiness,
        leading on to an ocean of love.
        Where her and I sail our boat,
        hand in hand,
        side by side,
        forever and always.
        </p>
